    Provisional buyer signals for relevance and localization: product availability, pricing, currency, tax, shipping, payment methods, and eligibility (e.g., student or affiliation discounts). Businesses SHOULD use these values when authoritative data (e.g., address) is absent, and MAY ignore unsupported values without returning errors. Context SHOULD be non-identifying and can be disclosed progressively—coarse signals early, finer resolution as the session progresses. Higher-resolution data (shipping address, billing address) supersedes context. Platforms SHOULD progressively enhance context throughout the buyer journey.

    The country. Recommended to be in 2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format, for example "US". For backward compatibility, a 3-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code such as "SGP" or a full country name such as "Singapore" can also be used.

    Background context describing buyer's intent (e.g., 'looking for a gift under $50', 'need something durable for outdoor use'). Informs relevance, recommendations, and personalization.
